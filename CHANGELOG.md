# Changelog

All notable changes to **METU Mail Notifier** are documented in this file.

The format is loosely inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- **Login warning shown as OS notification on startup** — `showNotificationOverlay` now returns `true`/`false` to indicate whether the notification was actually delivered to a tab. Login and session-expired notifications no longer fall back to the native OS notification when no injectable tab is available (e.g. browser just started, only `chrome://newtab` is open). Instead, they return `false` and `runAuthCheck` skips marking `hasWarnedLogin: true`, so the next `auth_check` alarm (≤1 min later) retries delivery once a real tab exists. New-mail alerts continue to fall back to `chrome.notifications` as before.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added

- **In-page toast notifications** — replaced the `chrome.windows` popup with a Shadow DOM overlay injected into the user's active tab via `chrome.scripting.executeScript`. The toast is fully isolated from the host page's CSS using `attachShadow({ mode: 'open' })`.
- **Notification sounds** — Web Audio API chimes synthesised on the fly (no audio files): ascending two-note sine chime for new mail; descending triangle-wave tone for session/login warnings.
- **Sound toggle** — enables or disables the audio chime from the popup.
- **Master enable/disable toggle** — pauses the entire extension (clears all alarms, stops checks) and resumes it instantly. Powered by a `chrome.storage.onChanged` listener in the service worker so changes take effect without a reload.
- **Disabled overlay** — a blurred overlay with a paused-state message covers the popup's settings section when the extension is disabled, matching the Cookie Guardian design pattern.
- **Native notification fallback** — when no injectable `http/https` tab is available (e.g. the only open tab is `chrome://newtab`), falls back to `chrome.notifications` for an OS-level notification.
- **Popup redesign** — adopted the Cookie Guardian Uber-inspired design system: system-ui font stack, `#000`/`#fff` neutrals, 8 px card radius, pill toggles, card shadow, section labels, option-list layout, and animated status toast chips.
- **Popup CSS split** — extracted all popup styles into a dedicated `popup.css` file.

### Fixed

- **Login-page detection false negative** — `looksLikeRoundcubeLogin` previously scanned only the first 2 000 characters of the inbox HTML response. METU Roundcube's `<head>` section pushes login-form markers beyond that cutoff. Fixed by removing the `.slice(0, 2000)` so the full body is checked.
- **Session expiry not detected in STATE_2** — after logout, the Roundcube mail-list API returns HTTP 200 with `exec` containing `this.session_error("/?_task=login&_err=session")` rather than `add_message_row(...)` entries. The old code treated this as an empty inbox. Fixed by checking the `exec` string for `session_error` or `_task=login` before looking for UIDs.

### Changed

- **Permissions** — added `scripting`, `tabs`, and `notifications`; removed `windows` (no longer used).
- **`host_permissions`** — added `<all_urls>` to allow toast injection into any active tab.
- **`manifest.json`** — version bumped to `1.1.0`; `icon.png` registered under `icons`.

## [1.0.0] — Initial release

- Two-state alarm-based check loop: `auth_check` (every 1 min) in STATE_1, `mail_check` (every 5 min) in STATE_2.
- Session detection via full-page fetch of `webmail.metu.edu.tr/?_task=mail&_mbox=INBOX` with `credentials: "include"`.
- CSRF token extraction from inbox HTML; mail-list API request using extracted token.
- New mail detection by comparing highest IMAP UID to `lastSeenId` in `chrome.storage.local`.
- Notification pop-up via `chrome.windows.create` (replaced in v1.1.0).
- Sound toggle stored in `chrome.storage.local`.
- Popup with sound toggle and status label.
